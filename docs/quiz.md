# Quiz Configuration

Quizzes live in `config/quizz/*.json` (alongside `config/game.json`, see [Configuration](configuration.md)).

Quizzes can be created in two ways:

- **Via the Quiz Editor**: use the built-in editor available in the manager dashboard (recommended)
- **Via JSON files**: manually create files in the `config/quizz/` directory

You can have multiple quiz files and select which one to use when starting a game.

Example quiz configuration (`config/quizz/example.json`):

```json
{
  "subject": "Example Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the correct answer?",
      "answers": ["No", "Yes", "No", "No"],
      "solutions": [1],
      "cooldown": 5,
      "time": 15
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these are primary colors?",
      "answers": ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"],
      "solutions": [0, 2, 3],
      "cooldown": 5,
      "time": 20
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct answer with an image?",
      "answers": ["No", "Yes", "No", "No"],
      "media": {
        "type": "image",
        "url": "https://placehold.co/600x400.png"
      },
      "solutions": [1],
      "cooldown": 5,
      "time": 20
    }
  ]
}
```
